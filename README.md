# CS-wk3
Dear All,
 
There is no prep this week. Please feel free to work on the extensions from previous preps if you would like to enrich your understanding. Importantly, if you have not completed all of your preps up to now, then you have this week to do so.
 
For those who would like an optional challenge, here you go:
 
Write a program which performs as follows
The user inputs a number (don’t worry about checking… assume the user is not a moron)
The program then outputs a triangle, in rows, in ascending order
 
Example: Input = 7

The trick here is that I would like your program to be the minimum number of lines of code. Less than 10 lines of code is certainly possible!
 
Please e-mail your program to me as an attachment so that I can give it a test run and marvel at how wonderfully intelligent you are.
 
Good luck have fun!
 
Best Wishes,
 
Mr Boshoff
